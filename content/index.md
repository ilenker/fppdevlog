# THINK, EXECUTE

## WHATISAMANAMI<br>SERABLELITTLE<br>PILEOFSECRETS 

A take on tetris based on the idea of placing a sequence of pieces in "batches".

A practise tool for planning ahead in Tetris.
You're given 4 pieces at a time (via the piece preview window)
which you need to place without visual feedback.

###### Overview:

1. write it in C
2. have it be a TUI app
3. modern tetris mechanics<ul><li>hard drops</li><li>spins</li><li>SRS</li></ul>

###### Considerations:

- Verticle aspect ratio of terminal characters. I need squares
- Accessibility for those unfamiliar with perfect finesse inputs
- Logic of how spins and slides are handled feels like it will be a doozey
- Spend no more than a couple of weeks to finish the project. (foreshadowing)
